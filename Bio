# My Bio

Hello! I'm Marilyn Lim, a passionate and certified cybersecurity professional dedicated to fortifying digital landscapes against ever-evolving threats. My journey in the cybersecurity realm has equipped me with a robust foundation in vulnerability assessment, threat management, network security, and penetration testing.

As a seasoned Cybersecurity Analyst, I thrive on delving into the intricacies of web application pen-testing, network pen-testing, network security, and vulnerability analysis. My proficiency in Linux/Kali Linux and hands-on experience in penetration testing allow me to proactively identify and neutralize potential security risks, ensuring that organizations remain secure in the digital frontier.

My technical prowess spans across diverse domains, including networking, shell scripting, reverse engineering, Windows Server, and IDS/IPS firewall configurations. This comprehensive knowledge empowers me to meticulously analyze and neutralize security threats, contributing to a resilient cybersecurity defense.

In my toolkit, you'll find an array of cutting-edge cybersecurity tools such as NMAP, Dirbuster, Nessus, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Zenmap, SIEM, OSINT, Netflow Analyzer, Alienvault, and the Shodan API. Leveraging these powerful resources, I conduct thorough vulnerability assessments, detect network anomalies, and perform advanced penetration testing to bolster security posture.

My journey in cybersecurity has been dotted with exciting projects and experiences. During the Code In Place program at Stanford University, I honed my creative problem-solving skills, leveraging Python3 programming to craft graphical programs that addressed real-world challenges.

As a Cybersecurity Intern at Brainnest, I actively engaged in simulated hacking exercises, elevating my expertise in reverse engineering and crafting custom scripts for vulnerability assessment. My passion for continuous growth and learning has driven me to excel in various competition-style CTF challenges, further advancing my web application penetration testing skills.

Education has always been a pivotal pillar in my professional growth. I earned a Cybersecurity Certificate of Completion from Per Scholas, Dallas, TX, and achieved the prestigious CompTIA CySA+ certification, validating my cybersecurity acumen. Additionally, I completed CS106A - Computer Science at Stanford University, gaining invaluable insights into essential computer science concepts.

Beyond my cybersecurity accolades, I'm known for my empathetic nature and exceptional interpersonal skills. Previously, I worked as a Licensed Funeral Director, where I provided compassionate support to grieving families during emotionally challenging times.

As my cybersecurity journey unfolds, I'm dedicated to making a positive impact in the cybersecurity domain. My ever-evolving cybersecurity portfolio stands as a testament to my unwavering commitment to secure digital landscapes and create a safer online environment.

I invite you to explore and join me on this thrilling cybersecurity adventure!
